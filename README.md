# terrorismWorldwide
A study on trends for terrorism-related incidents.


EDIT: When comitting, I forgot to add the csv files. That's why there's an error. Unfortunately, the csv files are too large to add to this repo, so 
you'll have to download them from Kaggle. The links should be in the code.

MAKE SURE you have downloaded the csv files and added their paths into the code to make sure it functions. IT WILL NOT FUNCTION if there is no data 
to analyze.
